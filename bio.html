    </h1>
    <p>
        Dan Meyer was born in Manhasset, NY, a small suburban town on Long
        Island only about a 45 minute train ride away from New York City.
        He went to Manhasset High school, where he was heavily involved in
        music, playing in the jazz band, marching band, wind ensemble, and
        orchestra.

        After high school, Dan went to college at Tufts University to pursue a
        bachelor's degree in computer science. To this day, Dan still attends
        Tufts and writes short autobiographies for classes like Web Programming.
